# LifeQuest Objective Manager

LifeQuest Objective Manager is a Clarity smart contract system designed to securely manage participant objectives in a decentralized environment. It ensures participant confidentiality while allowing dynamic objective creation, updates, importance assignment, timeframes, validation, and delegation.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Identity-Based Objective Management:**  
  Each participant's objectives are securely tied to their blockchain identity.

- **Flexible Objective Updates:**  
  Participants can modify the details and completion status of their objectives.

- **Objective Timeframe Tracking:**  
  Set target block heights for objective completion with notification readiness.

- **Importance Tier Assignment:**  
  Classify objectives into different tiers of importance (1-3).

- **Objective Delegation:**  
  Participants can delegate new objectives to other identities.

- **Existence Verification:**  
  Retrieve and validate the status and metadata of an objective.

## üìú Functions Overview

- `establish-objective (context)`  
  Create a new objective tied to your identity.

- `update-objective (context, completed)`  
  Update your existing objective‚Äôs context and status.

- `eliminate-objective`  
  Delete your objective.

- `specify-objective-timeframe (blocks-ahead)`  
  Set a target completion block for your objective.

- `assign-importance-tier (importance-tier)`  
  Assign an importance level (1 = highest priority, 3 = lower priority).

- `verify-objective-validity`  
  Check if your objective exists and retrieve basic metadata.

- `delegate-objective (target-entity, context)`  
  Create an objective for another participant.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Error Codes

- `OBJECTIVE-ALREADY-EXISTS` (409 Conflict)
- `OBJECTIVE-MALFORMED-INPUT` (400 Bad Request)
- `OBJECTIVE-NONEXISTENT` (404 Not Found)
